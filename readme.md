# GitHub Tweaks

> A Chrome extension to help protect your eyes from GitHub's new blue url color.

I was inspired to build this extension so that GitHub's new blue url color would
**stop burning holes in my eyes**, and setting my monitor on fire. :eyes: :fire: :desktop_computer: :fire:

In the options, you can choose the URL color that you want to use on GitHub.

## Install

Install [manually](http://superuser.com/a/247654/6877). Soon it will be available
on the Chrome Web Store.

## Roadmap

This extension was primarily built to save my eyes from GitHub's new blue URL color,
but in the future I may add more GitHub tweaks. Please open issues if you would
like to make feature suggestions.
