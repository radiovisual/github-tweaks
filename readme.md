# GitHub Tweaks

> Chrome extension that helps change some of GitHub's appearance and behaviors.

I was inspired to build this extension so that GitHub's new Blue url color would
stop burning holes in my eyes, and setting my monitor on fire. :eyes: :fire: :desktop_computer: :fire:

In the options, you can choose the url color, and the hover color.
